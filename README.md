# Introductory-Machine-Learning
School project to better understand Supervised Learning
To conduct a comparison of classification across our different models, we chose 3 different datasets that are of varying size 
and complexity. This report will break down the comparison first by giving some explanation of the datasets and exploratory data analysis,
then we will discuss each individual model’s performance on each dataset. Finally, we will summarize a comparison between the models on 
each dataset. In this way, we hope to test the ‘no free lunch’ theorem, which stipulates that no one model will be the best selection 
for every dataset.
